# The-Flotation
This project is to predict % Silica in ore concentrate in Flotation Plant using Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regressioin, Lasso Regression and XGBoost

The data came from The Flotation Plant. The data have several columns,the first column is date, the second and third columns are quality measures of the iron ore pulp right before it is fed into the flotation plant. Column 4 until column 8 are the most important variables that impact in the ore quality in the end of the process. From column 9 until column 22, we can see process data (level and air flow inside the flotation columns, which also impact in ore quality. The last two columns are the final iron ore pulp quality measurement from the lab. 

**The Problem**
1. The aim is to predict the % Silica in Concentrate ever minute
2. can we predict % Silica in Concentrate without using % Iron Concentrate?

**The Steps**
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Modelling 
3. Evaluating
4. Tunning Model
